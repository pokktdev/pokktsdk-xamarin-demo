#POKKT SDK Unity Integration Guide (v 6.0)##OverviewThank you for choosing Pokkt SDK for Xamarin . This document contains all the information required to set up the SDK with your project. We also support mediation for various third party networks. To know the supported third party networks and their integration process go tomediation section.
Before implementing plugins it is mandatory to go through project configuration and implementation steps , as these sections contain mandatory steps for basic SDK integration and are followed by every plugin.
You can download our SDK from pokkt.com .
In the android package downloaded above you will find:
1. Docs:Contains documentations for step wise step integration for SDK.
2. PokktAds Demo:Source code for PokktAds Demo(Sample app) which showcase implementation ofPokkt SDK through code for better understanding.
3. PokktAds Demo.apk:Application package of PoktkAds Demo, so that you can directly install this apk onyour device and have a look how our SDK works instead of compiling the sourcecode.
4. Extensions:PokktExtension.dll and P okktExtension.Droid.dll both of these are required by Pokkt SDK and should be added to project
5. Extensions with Analytics:PokktExtension.dll and P okktExtension.Droid.dll both of these are required by PokktSDK and should be added to project, these one contains moat and comscore analytics. We recommend you to use these dlls.

minSdkVersion supported is 11 .

In the iOS package downloaded above you will find:

###Setting Extension (Android)

1. You need to set extension before calling any method like below. This should be the firstcall.`PokktAds.SetNativeExtentions(new AndroidExtension(this));`

###Setting Extension (iOS)

1. You need to set extension before calling any method like below. This should be the first call.
	`PokktAds.SetNativeExtentions(new iOSExtension(this));`

###Common Configuration Steps	
1. Set Application Id and Security key in Pokkt SDK. You can get it from Pokkt dashboard from your account. We generally assign unique application Id and Security key.
	`PokktAds.SetPokktConfig(“<Pokkt Application ID>”, “<Pokkt Security Key>”);`
2. If you are using server to server integration with Pokkt, you can also set Third Party UserId in PokktAds.
	`PokktAds.SetThirdPartyUserId(“<Third party user Id>”);`
	3. When your application is under development and if you want to see Pokkt logs and other informatory messages, you can enable it by setting ShouldDebug to true . Make sure to disable debugging before release.
	`PokktAds.Debugging.ShouldDebug(<true>);`##Ad Types###Video● Video ad can be rewarded or non-rewarded. You can either cache the ad in advance or directly call show for it.
● We suggest you to cache the ad in advance so as to give seamless play behaviour, In other case it will stream the video which may lead to unnecessary buffering delays depending on the network connection.
####Rewarded1. To cache rewarded ad call:
	`PokktAds.VideoAd.CacheRewarded(“<ScreenName>”);`
2. To show rewarded ad call:
	`PokktAds.VideoAd.ShowRewarded(“<ScreenName>”);`
	####Non Rewarded1. To cache non-rewarded ad call:
	`PokktAds.VideoAd.CacheNonRewarded(“<ScreeName>”);`
	2. To show non-rewarded ad call:
	`PokktAds.VideoAd.ShowNonRewarded(“<ScreeName>”);`
		You can check if ad is available or not before making cache or show request.
	`PokktAds.VideoAd.CheckAdAvailability(“<screen name>”, <true / false>);`###Interstitial####Rewarded1. To cache rewarded ad call:
	`PokktAds.Interstitial.CacheRewarded(“<ScreenName>”);`
2. To show rewarded ad call:
	`PokktAds.Interstitial.ShowRewarded(“<ScreenName>”);`
####Non Rewarded1. To cache non-rewarded ad call:

	`PokktAds.Interstitial.CacheNonRewarded(“<ScreeName>”);`
2. To show non-rewarded ad call:
	`PokktAds.Interstitial.ShowNonRewarded(“<ScreenName>”);`
	You can check if ad is available or not before making cache or show request.
	PokktAds.Interstitial.CheckAdAvailability(“<screen name>”, <true / false>);
	###BannerThere are two ways to load banners:
####1. Load banner	PokktManager.LoadBanner(<ScreenName>, <BannerPosition>);
There are predefined positions for banner positioning inside BannerPosition (Com.Pokkt.Plugin.Common.BannerPosition ) .~~~● TOP_LEFT.● TOP_CENTER.● TOP_RIGHT.● MIDDLE_LEFT.● MIDDLE_CENTER.● MIDDLE_RIGHT.● BOTTOM_LEFT.● BOTTOM_CENTER.● BOTTOM_RIGHT.
~~~####2. Load banner with rect

~~~

PokktAds.Banner.LoadBannerWithRect(<ScreenName>,<Height>, Width>, <x>,<y>);Height : Custom height for banner.Width: Custom width for banner.x: Point x on screen to show banner.y: Point y on screen to show banner.
~~~

####3. Remove BannerYou can remove Banner using:<br>`PokktAds.Banner.RemoveBanner();`

####4. Auto refresh BannerYou can also set banner to auto-refresh using:<br>`PokktAds.Banner.ShouldAutoRefresh(<true/false>)`
##Ad ActionsAd actions are optional, but we suggest to implement them as it will help you to keep track of the status of your ad request.
###Video

~~~PokktAds.VideoAd.AdAvailabilityEvent += AdAvailabilityStatus;PokktAds.VideoAd.AdCachingCompletedEvent += AdCachingCompleted;PokktAds.VideoAd.AdCachingFailedEvent += AdCachingFailed;PokktAds.VideoAd.AdDisplayedEvent += AdDisplayed;PokktAds.VideoAd.AdFailedToShowEvent += AdFailedToShow;PokktAds.VideoAd.AdSkippedEvent += AdSkipped;PokktAds.VideoAd.AdCompletedEvent += AdCompleted;PokktAds.VideoAd.AdClosedEvent += AdClosed;PokktAds.VideoAd.AdGratifiedEvent += AdGratified;

##Pokkt Ad player configurationPokkt Ad player works the way App is configured at Pokkt dashboard, but we provide a way to override those settings using PokktAdPlayerViewConfig .
Application should prefer configuration provided through code by developer or what’s configured for the app in dashboard, can be controlled any time through the dashboard itself. If you want tomake changes to this configuration after your app distribution, you can contact Pokkt Team to do the same for your app through admin console.

~~~PokktAdPlayerViewConfig adPlayerViewConfig = new PokktAdPlayerViewConfig ();// set properties values to adPlayerViewConfigPokktAds.SetAdPlayerViewConfig(adPlayerViewConfig );
